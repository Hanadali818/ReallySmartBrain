README: Image Classification using ImageAI
This repository contains code for image classification using the ImageAI library by Moses Olafenwa 
https://github.com/OlafenwaMoses. The code utilizes a pre-trained MobileNetV2 model for classification.

Prerequisites
Python 3.x
ImageAI
PyTorch (for model loading)

Instructions
Clone this repository to your local machine:
git clone <repository-url>
Navigate to the directory containing the Python script.

Ensure that Python dependencies are installed, including ImageAI and PyTorch.

Run the Python script (image_classification.py).

About the Code
Image Classification
The script loads a pre-trained MobileNetV2 model using the ImageAI library. This model is then used to classify images into various categories.

Model Loading
The MobileNetV2 model is loaded from the provided model path (mobilenet_v2-b0353104.pth). Ensure that the model file exists in the specified location.

Making Predictions
The script takes an input image (house.jpg in this case), classifies it, and returns the top 5 predictions along with their probabilities.
